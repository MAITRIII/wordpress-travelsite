SEOlib is SEO optimized for the search engines Google and Bing, while being a modern and simple responsive WordPress theme. Journalists, writers and authors can use it to publish news through blogging or writing with our minimalistic multipurpose magazine / newspaper theme. We have made clean code so the load time is fast, quick page speed is a big part of our SEO friendly theme. Whether you like food, fashion, photography, travel or need a business portfolio then our minimal article theme is a good choice. If you are a corporate business or agency, you can use it to design your creative & elegant landing page. Bloggers can use ads like adsense and affiliate marketing for your blog page about books, actors or other entertainment as well as write a journal / biography about your personal life with our typography optimised, reading friendly, flat and light design. We don’t yet fully support websites having a one page / single page with post builder plugins, but we will add that soon together with making special white and dark layouts for school, education, coach and conference sites. SEOlib has many features such as widgets, header image and responsive design so it works on mobile phones too.

== About The Author ==

Hi! My name is Gregor, I am born in Germany, I spend a lot of time creating WordPress themes when I'm not doing consulent work as a search engine optimization consultant. I learned to code so I was able to do on page SEO as well as off page.
 
I often get questions if it's okay to fork the way I build features, my CSS and my php.
The answer is short YES, you are always allowed to fork whatever code you want off my themes and create something amazing. WordPress wouldn't be able to exist without people co-creating things, so the only thing I ask in return, is that if you improve some of my code, please share it with me so I can implement it :D

You can fork my entire themes and redesign them if you want, so no restrictions - All I ask is that you mention that you have based your theme on mine and that it is also based on Underscores & Nisarg by Falguni Desai(Credits for both can be found in the bottom), since my theme is based on those two awesome themes. If you have questions then you can always contact me via beseenseo@gmail.com then I'll do my best to help fellow develoers out
 
My themes will in the future be supported via a new upcoming website called Outstanding because I am teaming up with some other developers to make even greater themes, please write there for theme support and to my personal email for other things.

Gregor over and out!
